        <p>The second floor was rotted. Not neglected—<em>devoured</em>. Each step sank, groaned, threatened to splinter beneath my weight. The hallway whispered. Not wind—<span class="bloody">words</span>.</p>
        <p>"<span class="hidden-message">...turn back...</span>"</p>
        <p>I reached the door marked <strong>203</strong>. The number was written in fingernail scratches. The wood was damp, as if something on the other side was <em>breathing on it</em>.</p>

        <p>I opened the door. Slowly. The hinges wailed.</p>
        <p>The room was red. Not painted — <strong>soaked</strong>. Bed, walls, ceiling. Soaked in a thick, dark red that pulsed faintly when I stepped inside.</p>
        <p>In the center of the room stood a **mirror**. But it didn’t show me. It showed <em>Sam</em>.</p>
        <p>He was screaming. Trapped. Mouth open, but silent. Hands pressed to the glass. Behind him, something crawled on the ceiling, upside down, jointless limbs twitching with static.</p>
        <p><span class="bloody glitchy-text">GET OUT</span></p>
        <p>I reached for the mirror — and it reached back. The surface rippled like water. Its hand was cold. Bone. Not flesh.</p>
        <p>I ran. But the hallway was gone. In its place was a stairwell that spiraled <em>down</em>, deeper than the house should allow. Deeper than the earth. Screams echoed from below — including my own.</p>
        <p>I’m still running.</p>
        <p>But the stairs <strong>never end</strong>.</p>
