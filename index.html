          <p>Cops dont even go in there. Animals dont go near there. It wasn’t superstition. It was survival. The street just… ends. No cul-de-sac. No fence. No explanation. And beyond it is that house on Monty Lane.

          <p> Choked in ivy. Windows sealed with something like soot — not from fire, but from something darker. The grass grows tall enough to hide a child. The air hums, like the ground is holding its breath.

Rumor says he saw something moving behind the walls — not mice. Not pipes. Something waiting. I went back this year. Alone. I needed to know what happened to Sam. Needed to see. The front door opened by itself. The hallway was silent. Furniture under sheets. Wallpaper peeled in long strips like skin. And the smell… it was wrong. Like rust. Like something metallic left out in the sun. Like... TEETH

              <p>In the foyer were photos. Framed. Dozens. Black and white. Children. Pale. Wide-eyed. Frozen. And beneath each one, etched deep into the wood: <span class="bloody">STILL HERE.</span> Their mouths were closed in the photos. But as I passed, I swear I saw a lip twitch. At the base of the stairs, I found Sam’s backpack. Still zipped. Still clean. Still warm. I should’ve left. I heard it before I saw it. The creak of a floorboard above me. Then another. Then breathing. Wet. Labored. Too close. I ran upstairs. The hallway bent in ways it shouldn’t. Too long. Too narrow. The walls breathed, in and out, like lungs. Something giggled, but it wasn’t human. And it wasn’t ahead of me. It was behind me. I ran into the last room on the left. The nursery. Empty crib. Mobile still spinning, even with the window shut. A melody that didn’t sound like any lullaby I’ve ever known — more like something that mimicked one. On the wall, something written in a child’s handwriting: <span class="bloody hidden-message">DON’T BLINK.</span> Then I heard it. Tiny feet. Behind me. I turned, slowly. Inside the crib was not a baby. It was something else. Small. Gray. Grinning. With no eyes — just empty, pulsing holes. Its mouth opened slowly, revealing rows and rows of needle teeth. And from inside its throat: “He’s still here.” I screamed. I don’t remember leaving. I don’t remember how I got home. But when I checked my voicemail that night, there was a message. No number. Just static. And faintly, beneath the white noise: <span class="bloody glitchy-text">YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE COME BACK.</span> I still dream of that house. Except now… I don’t wake up.
