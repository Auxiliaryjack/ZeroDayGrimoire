     <h2>Everyone in town pretends the house on Monty Lane isn’t there.</h2>
    <p>It doesn’t show up on Google Maps. There’s no street number on the curb. The property lines skip over it like a blank space. </p>

            <p>But if you walk far enough down that road, past the overgrown hedges and the mailbox full of dead bees, you’ll find it.Quaint. Quietly decaying. Charred black around the windows like it had once caught fire — but never burned down.I went there on a dare.It was supposed to be just pictures. In, out, done. The front door was already open. The air inside was wet and cold, like a freezer that had recently thawed. The floorboards moaned like they hated being stepped on.The house smelled like teeth. </p>

            <p>I made it to the staircase before I noticed the portraits. There were dozens, covering the walls — all of them black-and-white photos of people sitting perfectly still, eyes wide and mouth closed. But not old people. Children. Each of them wearing the same old-fashioned school uniform. Same blank expression. Same cloudy, unfocused eyes. And all of them had something scratched into the bottom corner of the frame: STILL HERE.</p>
